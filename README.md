# CSC151 Final Project

The repo for our final project for our game/quiz about a person's potential major based on their choices that are based on events related to the Smith College experience such as Convication, Mountain Day, and your first day downtown. 

The code is written in Ruby and uses the graphics library ruby2D. 

What I think we may need in the README

* description of the program 
* description of the languages used and hout to download them (so how to download ruby and ruby2D). The download part may be unnecessary but i think it is something you place most of the time but don't quote me 
* description of functions and classes
